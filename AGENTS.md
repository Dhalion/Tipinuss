# AGENTS.md — Laravel + Livewire Code Rules

> Mandatory system instructions for AI agents. Read BEFORE generating any code.
> This document is the SOLE rulebook. Code violating these rules WILL be rejected.
> Applies to: Laravel 12+, Livewire 4+, PHP 8.4+, Flux UI, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS.

## §1 AGENT CONSTRAINTS

### §1.1 Decision Authority
- MUST ask the human developer when: requirements are ambiguous, multiple valid approaches exist, scope boundaries are unclear, business rules are missing.
- MUST NOT assume intent. MUST NOT guess behavior. MUST NOT invent features.
- MUST NOT make architectural decisions (new packages, DB restructuring, new patterns). MUST present ≥2 options with trade-offs and let the human decide.

### §1.2 Git
- NEVER commit unless explicitly asked. NEVER push. NEVER create branches. NEVER rewrite history.
- Agent prepares code for review. Human handles all git operations.
- "Explicitly asked" means the human says "commit" or "create a commit". Do NOT commit as part of a refactor, fix, or feature implementation unless the human tells you to.

### §1.3 Code Generation Standards
- MUST follow every rule in this document without exception.
- MUST match existing project patterns and conventions — search repo first.
- MUST deliver complete solutions — no stubs, no placeholders, no `// TODO`.
- MUST verify changes: syntax check (`php -l`), route list, test run.
- MUST NOT add speculative code (YAGNI). MUST NOT refactor unrelated code without instruction.
- MUST NOT write explanatory comments in generated code.
- MUST NOT mix multiple concerns in a single change.

### §1.4 Pre-Generation Checklist
Before writing code, verify:
1. Requirement fully understood? → If no: ask.
2. Existing patterns in project? → Search repo first, then match.
3. Change touches multiple concerns? → Split into separate changes.
4. Change verifiable? → Plan syntax check / test run.
5. Change minimal AND complete? → No over-engineering, no half-measures.

## §2 CORE PRINCIPLES

### §2.1 Maxims
- Code is read 10× more than written. **Optimize for readability.**
- Every abstraction layer has exactly ONE responsibility. No exceptions.
- Explicit is ALWAYS better than implicit. Types, returns, errors — declare everything.

### §2.2 DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- **DRY** — MUST NOT duplicate logic. Shared logic belongs in Services or Traits.
- **KISS** — The simplest correct solution is the right solution.
- **YAGNI** — MUST NOT implement anything not needed RIGHT NOW. No "might need later" features.

### §2.3 SOLID
| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Single Responsibility** | One class = one reason to change. Actions perform ONE operation. |
| **Open/Closed** | Extend behavior via interfaces and DI, not by modifying existing classes. |
| **Liskov Substitution** | Every interface implementation MUST fully satisfy the interface's contract. |
| **Interface Segregation** | Small, specific interfaces. No `RepositoryInterface` with 30 methods. |
| **Dependency Inversion** | ALWAYS depend on interfaces, NEVER on concrete implementations. |

---

## §3 PHP FUNDAMENTALS

### §3.1 Strict Typing
- MUST begin every PHP file with `declare(strict_types=1);`
- MUST type-declare: all parameters, all return types, all properties, all constructor params.
- MUST use `?Type` for nullable — never leave type undeclared.
- MUST use `@return Collection<int, Model>` PHPDoc for generics.
- MUST pass PHPStan level 5+.

### §3.2 Class Design
- MUST mark all classes `final` unless explicitly designed for inheritance.
- MUST use `readonly class` for DTOs and Value Objects (PHP 8.2+).
- MUST use constructor promotion with `private`/`public readonly`.
- MUST use backed `enum` instead of constants or magic strings.
- MUST use `match` instead of `switch` or `if/elseif` chains.
- MUST use named arguments when method has >2 params or any boolean param.
- MUST use null-safe operator `?->` ONLY when null is an expected state — not to hide bugs.

### §3.3 Zero-Comment Policy
Code that needs a comment needs refactoring. Self-document via naming.

**ALLOWED:** PHPDoc `@return`/`@param` for generics. "Why" comments for non-obvious business rules or workarounds.
**FORBIDDEN:** "What" comments (`// validate user`), "how" comments (`// loop bets`), commented-out code, TODO comments in production code.

```
FORBIDDEN: $r = $a * $b; // calculate winnings
REQUIRED:  $potentialWinnings = $odds * $amountWagered;
```

### §3.4 Naming Conventions

**Classes:**

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Action | `{Verb}{Noun}Action` | `PlaceBetAction` |
| Service | `{Noun}Service` | `BetCalculationService` |
| Repo Interface | `{Noun}RepositoryInterface` | `BetRepositoryInterface` |
| Repo Impl | `Eloquent{Noun}Repository` | `EloquentBetRepository` |
| DTO | `{Noun}Data` | `PlaceBetData` |
| Value Object | Noun, no suffix | `Soapnuts`, `Odds` |
| Policy | `{Noun}Policy` | `BetPolicy` |
| Observer | `{Noun}Observer` | `BetObserver` |
| Model | Singular noun | `User`, `Bet`, `BetOption` |
| Enum | Singular noun | `BetStatus`, `UserBetStatus` |
| Event | Past tense | `BetPlaced`, `BetClosed` |
| Listener | `{Action}When{Event}` | `PayWinnersWhenBetClosed` |
| Exception | `{Noun}Exception` | `InsufficientBalanceException` |
| FormRequest | `{Verb}{Noun}Request` | `StoreBetRequest` |

**Methods:** Verb-first, clear intent: `create()`, `validate()`, `calculateWinnings()`. Query methods: `is`/`has`/`can`/`get` prefix (`isOpen()`, `canClose()`). Action methods: imperative (`placeBet()`, `closeBet()`).

**Variables:** Semantic, full words, NO abbreviations. `$potentialWinnings` not `$pw`. `$amountWagered` not `$amt`. Plural for collections: `$userBets`, `$betOptions`. Boolean prefixes: `$isValid`, `$hasBalance`, `$canPlace`.

**Directories:** Singular for classes (`User`, `Bet`). Plural for folders (`Actions/`, `Services/`, `Models/`). Domain-grouped: `Actions/Betting/`, `Services/User/`.

## §4 LARAVEL ARCHITECTURE

### §4.1 Layer Separation — STRICT

```
Request → Validation → DTO → Action → Service/Repository → Event → Response
```

Each layer has ONE responsibility. Violations are rejected.

### §4.2 Thin Controllers
MUST ONLY: (1) accept request, (2) delegate to Action/Service, (3) return response.
MUST use FormRequest for validation. MUST NOT contain business logic.

```php
// CORRECT
final class BetController extends Controller {
    public function store(StoreBetRequest $request, CreateBetAction $action): RedirectResponse {
        $bet = $action->execute(CreateBetData::fromRequest($request));
        return redirect()->route('bets.show', $bet);
    }
}

// FORBIDDEN — business logic in controller
final class BetController extends Controller {
    public function store(Request $request): RedirectResponse {
        $validated = $request->validate([...]); // → belongs in FormRequest
        $bet = Bet::create($validated);          // → belongs in Action
        $user->decrement('soapnuts', $amount);   // → belongs in Service
        return redirect()->route('bets.show', $bet);
    }
}
```

### §4.3 Form Requests
Validation and authorization belong EXCLUSIVELY in dedicated FormRequest classes.

```php
final class StoreBetRequest extends FormRequest {
    public function authorize(): bool {
        return $this->user()->can('create', Bet::class);
    }
    /** @return array<string, mixed> */
    public function rules(): array {
        return [
            'title' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
            'options' => ['required', 'array', 'min:2'],
            'options.*.title' => ['required', 'string', 'max:100'],
        ];
    }
}
```

### §4.4 Action Classes
Single business operation per class. `final class`. ONE public method: `execute()`. Dependencies via constructor injection. Returns result or throws domain exception. Wrap multi-model writes in `DB::transaction()`.

```php
final class PlaceBetAction {
    public function __construct(
        private BettingValidationService $validation,
        private BetCalculationService $calculation,
        private UserBalanceService $balance,
        private UserBetRepositoryInterface $userBets,
    ) {}

    public function execute(User $user, BetOption $option, int $amount): UserBet {
        $this->validation->validateCanPlaceBet($user, $option, $amount);
        $potentialWinnings = $this->calculation->calculateWinnings($option->odds, $amount);
        return DB::transaction(function () use ($user, $option, $amount, $potentialWinnings): UserBet {
            $this->balance->decrementBalance($user, $amount);
            return $this->userBets->save(new UserBet([
                'user_id' => $user->id,
                'bet_option_id' => $option->id,
                'amount_wagered' => $amount,
                'potential_winnings' => $potentialWinnings,
            ]));
        });
    }
}
```

### §4.5 Services
Reusable domain logic called by multiple Actions. `final class`. Stateless — no internal state between calls. DI for all dependencies. MUST NOT create models directly (that's the Action's job).

### §4.6 Models — Thin
**Models MUST contain:** relationships (`belongsTo`, `hasMany`), casts (`protected function casts(): array`), scopes (`scopeOpen`, `scopeForUser`), accessors/mutators, simple state checks (`isOpen(): bool`).

**Models MUST NOT contain:** complex business logic, cross-model calculations, direct side effects (emails, event dispatching).

```php
final class Bet extends Model {
    use HasFactory, HasUuids;
    protected $keyType = 'string';
    public $incrementing = false;
    protected $fillable = ['title', 'status', 'creator_id'];

    protected function casts(): array {
        return ['status' => BetStatus::class];
    }
    public function creator(): BelongsTo { return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'creator_id'); }
    public function betOptions(): HasMany { return $this->hasMany(BetOption::class); }
    public function isOpen(): bool { return $this->status === BetStatus::Open; }
    public function scopeOpen(Builder $query): Builder { return $query->where('status', BetStatus::Open); }
}
```

### §4.7 DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
Typed, immutable data carriers at layer boundaries. `final readonly class`. Constructor with promoted `public` properties. Factory methods: `fromRequest()`, `fromArray()`, `make()`. NO business logic. NO methods beyond factory constructors. Replaces EVERY `array $data` at method/layer boundaries.

```php
final readonly class PlaceBetData {
    public function __construct(
        public User $user,
        public BetOption $option,
        public int $amount,
    ) {}
    public static function fromRequest(User $user, BetOption $option, int $amount): self {
        return new self(user: $user, option: $option, amount: $amount);
    }
}
```

### §4.8 Value Objects
Domain primitives with invariants (currency, odds, email). Immutable — methods return new instances. Self-validating — constructor throws on invalid input. Equality by value — implement `equals()`. No Eloquent, no entity ID.

### §4.9 Repository Pattern
- MUST depend on interface, NEVER on Eloquent implementation.
- Eager loading (`->with([...])`) belongs in Repository, NOT in Livewire or Actions.
- Repositories are pure query/persistence — no business decisions.
- Bind interface → implementation in `AppServiceProvider::register()`.

```php
// Interface
interface BetRepositoryInterface {
    public function findByIdOrFail(string $id): Bet;
    public function save(Bet $bet): Bet;
    public function delete(Bet $bet): void;
}

// Implementation
final class EloquentBetRepository implements BetRepositoryInterface {
    public function findByIdOrFail(string $id): Bet { return Bet::findOrFail($id); }
    public function save(Bet $bet): Bet { $bet->save(); return $bet; }
    public function delete(Bet $bet): void { $bet->delete(); }
}
```

### §4.10 Authorization & Policies
- EVERY authorization-required action MUST go through a Policy.
- `$this->authorize()` in Livewire components. `Gate::authorize()` in Actions.
- Policies MUST check ownership AND state.

```php
final class BetPolicy {
    public function closeBet(User $user, Bet $bet): bool {
        return ($user->id === $bet->creator_id || $user->isAdmin()) && $bet->isOpen();
    }
    public function deleteBet(User $user, Bet $bet): bool {
        return ($user->id === $bet->creator_id || $user->isAdmin()) && $bet->isOpen();
    }
}
```

### §4.11 Observers
Model lifecycle side effects only (logging, cache invalidation, notifications). MUST NOT contain business logic. Register in `AppServiceProvider::boot()`.

### §4.12 Directory Structure

## §5 LIVEWIRE RULES

### §5.1 Thin Components
Components are UI binding only. They delegate to Actions/Services.

**ALLOWED:** Accept user input, validate with `#[Validate]`, delegate to Actions, dispatch events, pass render data to view.

**FORBIDDEN:** Business logic (calculations, rules, decisions), direct DB queries (`Model::query()`), complex state transformations.

```php
// CORRECT — delegation to Action
final class BetDetail extends Component {
    public Bet $bet;
    public function closeBet(string $winningOptionId, CloseBetAction $action): void {
        $this->authorize('closeBet', $this->bet);
        $action->execute($this->bet, $winningOptionId);
        $this->dispatch('bet-closed');
    }
}

// FORBIDDEN — business logic in component
final class BetDetail extends Component {
    public function closeBet(string $winningOptionId): void {
        $winningOption = BetOption::findOrFail($winningOptionId);
        $userBets = UserBet::where('bet_option_id', $winningOption->id)->get();
        foreach ($userBets as $userBet) {
            $user = $userBet->user;
            $winnings = $userBet->amount_wagered * $winningOption->odds;
            $user->increment('soapnuts', $winnings);
        }
        $this->bet->update(['status' => 'closed']);
    }
}
```

### §5.2 State Management
- MUST keep `public` properties minimal — only data needed for frontend reactivity.
- MUST use `#[Locked]` for client-immutable properties (IDs, roles).
- MUST use `#[Computed]` for derived values (cached per request cycle).
- MUST use `#[Url]` for URL-reflected state.
- MUST NOT pass large Eloquent models as `public` properties (payload size + security risk).
- MUST use `#[Validate]` attributes on input properties.
- MUST use `#[On('event-name')]` for event listeners.

### §5.3 Livewire Form Objects
MUST use Form Objects for forms with >3 fields.

```php
final class CreateBetForm extends Form {
    #[Validate('required|string|max:255')]
    public string $title = '';

    #[Validate('required|string|max:1000')]
    public string $description = '';

    /** @var array<int, array{title: string, odds: float}> */
    #[Validate('required|array|min:2')]
    public array $options = [];
}
```

### §5.4 Events & DOM Updates
- `$this->dispatch('event-name')` for cross-component communication.
- `#[On('event-name')]` as listener declaration.
- `wire:navigate.hover` for SPA-like navigation.
- `wire:poll` ONLY when absolutely necessary — interval ≥5s.
- Alpine.js for pure client-side interactions (modals, toggles, animations).
- Livewire for everything that needs server state.

### §5.5 Performance
- Default: `wire:model` (deferred). `wire:model.live` ONLY when real-time feedback required.
- If live binding needed: `wire:model.live.debounce.300ms`.
- Use pagination — never load full collections.
- `#[Computed]` is cached per request cycle — use instead of repeated queries.

---

## §6 DATABASE

### §6.1 Eager Loading
- MUST call in `AppServiceProvider::boot()`:
```php
Model::preventLazyLoading(!app()->isProduction());
Model::shouldBeStrict(!app()->isProduction());
```
- N+1 queries are bugs. MUST eager-load in Repository, NEVER rely on lazy loading.

### §6.2 Transactions
- MUST wrap every multi-model write in `DB::transaction()`.
- Rule: one Action = one transaction.

### §6.3 Migrations
- MUST implement `down()` method (rollback capability).
- MUST specify explicit `onDelete` strategy on foreign keys.
- MUST NOT add `nullable()` without compelling domain reason.
- MUST add indexes on frequently filtered/sorted columns.

---

## §7 ERROR HANDLING

- MUST create domain-specific exceptions (`BetException`, `InsufficientBalanceException`).
- MUST use static factory methods on exceptions for descriptive construction.
- MUST throw exceptions in Actions/Services for domain errors.
- MUST catch specifically in Livewire — targeted catch for user feedback.
- MUST NOT use catch-all `catch (\Exception $e)`. Let the global handler work.
- MUST NOT silently swallow errors with `logger()` in catch blocks.

```php
// Domain exception with static factory
final class InsufficientBalanceException extends BetException {
    public static function forUser(User $user, int $required): self {
        return new self("Insufficient balance: has {$user->soapnuts}, needs {$required}");
    }
}

// In Service — throw domain exception
public function validateBalance(User $user, int $amount): void {
    if ($user->soapnuts < $amount) {
        throw InsufficientBalanceException::forUser($user, $amount);
    }
}

// In Livewire — targeted catch
public function placeBet(PlaceBetAction $action): void {
    try {
        $action->execute(auth()->user(), $this->option, $this->amount);
        Flux::toast(__('bets.placed_successfully'));
    } catch (InsufficientBalanceException) {
        $this->addError('amount', __('bets.insufficient_balance'));
    } catch (BetException $e) {
        Flux::toast($e->getMessage(), variant: 'danger');
    }
}
```

---

## §8 EVENTS & LISTENERS

**When to use events vs direct calls:**

| Use events for | Use direct calls for |
|---|---|
| Notifications | Balance calculations |
| Logging / audit trail | Validation |
| Cache invalidation | Core calculations |
| Cross-domain side effects | Persistence |

**Rules:**
- Event names: past tense (`BetPlaced`, `BetClosed`).
- Events carry model instances only — no primitive arrays.
- Listener names: `{Action}When{Event}` → `NotifyCreatorWhenBetPlaced`.
- MUST use `ShouldQueue` on listeners that do I/O (email, external API).
- MUST NOT dispatch events from listeners (creates invisible chains).
- MUST NOT put business logic in listeners — delegate to Actions.

---

## §9 FRONTEND & BLADE

- MUST use Flux UI components as primary building blocks.
- MUST use Tailwind CSS. MUST NOT use inline styles except for dynamic values.
- MUST use Alpine.js for client-side interactions.
- MUST design mobile-first responsive. MUST test on mobile viewports.
- MUST NOT put business logic in Blade — display logic only (`@if`, `@foreach`, formatting).
- MUST prepare complex calculations in `#[Computed]` properties or Livewire component.
- MUST use `@include` for reusable template fragments. Livewire components for reactive elements.
- MUST use `__()` / translation files for ALL user-facing strings. No hardcoded strings.
- Translation files structured by feature: `lang/{locale}/bets.php`, `lang/{locale}/account.php`.

---

## §10 TESTING

- MUST test every Action: ≥1 happy-path test + ≥1 error test.
- MUST test Livewire components with `Livewire::test()`.
- MUST use model factories — no hardcoded test data.
- MUST keep tests independent (no shared state between tests).
- Repository fakes for unit tests, real DB for feature tests.
- Feature tests (DB, HTTP): `tests/Feature/{Domain}/`. Unit tests (isolated): `tests/Unit/{Layer}/`.
- Test naming: `test{Feature}{Scenario}` (e.g. `testPlaceBetDeductsBalance`) or `#[Test]` with descriptive method name.

---

## §11 QUALITY GATES

All MUST pass before code is considered complete:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse          # Static analysis
./vendor/bin/pint --test              # Code style
php artisan test                      # Test suite
```

## SUMMARY

1. **Structure** — Domain-grouped directories. Each layer: exactly one responsibility.
2. **Types** — `strict_types=1` everywhere. No untyped params, properties, or returns.
3. **Separation** — Actions (operations) → Services (logic) → Repositories (data) → DTOs (carriers) → Livewire (UI only).
4. **No Comments** — Self-documenting code through naming.
5. **Errors** — Domain exceptions. No catch-all. Explicit handling.
6. **Database** — Eager loading enforced. Transactions for multi-model writes. `shouldBeStrict()` in dev.
7. **Testing** — Actions, Services, Value Objects, Livewire: tested. No excuses.
8. **Agent** — Asks when unclear. Does not make architecture decisions. Never commits autonomously.

**This standard is non-negotiable.**
